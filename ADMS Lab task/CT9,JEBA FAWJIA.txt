•	Create an index on S_Id and S_Name columns from Student table.

CREATE INDEX Sid_name_idx
ON Student(S_Id,S_Name);


•	Write a subquery that displays those students who have IDs that are greater than Cedric’s.


 SELECT S_ID, S_NAME  FROM STUDENT
  		WHERE S_Id > ALL ( SELECT S_Id FROM Student WHERE S_Name= 'CEDRIC') ORDER BY S_Id ASC;
		
		
•	Write a join query that displays the Student Name and House Name of each student.

SELECT Student.S_Name AS "STUDENTS", House.H_Name AS "HOUSE-NAME"
		FROM Student, House 
	WHERE (Student.H_Id = House.H_Id);
	
	
•	Create a view consisting of only S_Name column from Student table. Make sure to untick the auto commit option before creating the view.


///////////[[ Firstly must untick the CHECKBOX  of AUTOCOMMIT placed at the left top corner of ORACLE SERVER JUST ABOVE THE STARTING LINESPACE FOR QUERY.... ]]

CREATE	VIEW	Student#Name
	AS SELECT  	S_Name
	FROM 		Student;
	
	
•	Write a query that deletes the created view.

DELETE FROM	Student#Name;

•	Using rollback re-create the deleted view.

ROLLBACK;

	//////////DO NOT FORGET TO MARK/SELECT THE CHECKBOX OF AUTOCOMMIT AGAIN 
				TO PROCEED FOR THE NEXT QUERIES AFTER THIS ROLLBACK ......................................
				
•	Create a synonym for the view you created earlier.


CREATE SYNONYM	Students FOR  Student#Name;
